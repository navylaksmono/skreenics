# Introduction #
Skreenics is a Mac OS X application that is designed to easily create thumbnails from your videos. You simply drag 'n drop files and folders onto the main screen, and Skreenics will generate the thumbnails the way you asked it!

# Bug or feature request #
Skreenics is in its early stages. I did not have much beta-tester for now, so... Yeah :D.
If you feel like Skreenics could benefit from some new feature, or if you found a bug, then please feel free to [file a bug/feature request](http://code.google.com/p/skreenics/issues/list)
